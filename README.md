# Flight-System
Level-one university project

The Flight System includes a few components such as Passengers, Seating Plan, Shop, yet this piece of code is dedicated to my component which is Flights. Using this code, one is able to search and select flights
based on user information (cities, dates, type of flight, etc). Error handling and clear interface are included.
