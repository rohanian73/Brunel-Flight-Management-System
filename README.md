# Brunel-Flight-Management-System

A service that provides functionalities of the flight ticket booking application. It is a desktop application that was developed within the Group Project Year 1 module at Brunel. My responsibilities covered the flight management.

• Designed the interface of the flight search form and the list of found flights, including the elements, interactions and error handlings of each page.
• Implemented such features as retrieving ticket data entered by a user in the input (JComboBox), finding relevant flight tickets by going through all tickets from the given database, displaying results using slider, storing data of the selected ticket in the common class allowing interaction with other application components.
• Conducted tests through implementing JUnit, for evaluating the performance and valid work of the application, and debugging, for identifying and fixing the errors.
